# Extract

Organise Pages that have a lot of children into a paginated tab. Set the parent Page to be an ExtractPage or an ExtractArchivePage page type.

Once set the Pages children will no longer display in the default Radiant Admin but within it's own paginated Tab.

It's a monkey patch so use at your own risk.

## To Do

- Write some specs.
- Look into cleaning up the views.
